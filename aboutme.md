subtitle: Looking for a job! Hire me after I complete Hack Reactor

My name is Mark Tyneway and I hold a BS in Molecular Neuroscience from SUNY Binghamton.
The allure of doing huge things through software changed my life trajectory, so I ended up at [Hack Reactor](www.hackreactor.com) to learn how to help fix the world.

I am interested in the intersection between neuroscience, lifestyle and technology.  The problems that software can solve can scale globally, so what kinds of products and services can we create to help enable healthy living across the world?
