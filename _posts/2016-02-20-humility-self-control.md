title: On Humility and Self-Control
subtitle: How effort can help make you a better person

#### Is it possible that there is a connection between being humble and having better self control?

Does it take a specific effort to maintain a disposition of "humbleness" instead of letting your ego run rampant?
Maybe the ability to self-regulate your ego through inducing humility requires disciplined effort.
If you have the discipline to maintain humility, then its possible that the discipline will spill over into other sectors
of your life.

Scientists tested the theory that humility
facilitates higher self control in their paper, [Humility Facilitates Higher Self-Control](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115001183),
and found evidence supporting it.

##### There theory
* Humble individuals are thought to be able to resist self-enhancing tendencies
  * A [self-enhancing tendency](http://www.academia.edu/180650/Individual_differences_in_self-enhancement_and_self-protection_strategies_An_integrative_analysis) is when a person views the world in a biased way to maintain a positive view of themselves.  It is basically a delusion that we all experience.
* There is evidence that self-enhancing tendencies are a dominant and automatic tendency
* Overriding natural tendencies requires considerable resources

According to the scientists:

What I take from this - practice makes perfect.  Humans have so many different tendencies that it
is difficult to know what is going on all the time.
Unless its just me.
So applying mindfulness to our biases - paying attention at a deeper level to the silly and potentially self-destructive
things that we do in our lives - could really help us achieve the happiness we so desperately seek.

If you work hard and learn how to resist self-enhancing urges, you may learn how to do it over time and develop
both humility and self-control that spills over into other parts of your life.
