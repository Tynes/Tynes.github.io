#### Mental and Physical Training 

If we all had a more detailed yet simple way to understand the mechanisms
behind how our behaviors impact our everyday health, we may adopt different habits.
Somebody posing as the Buddha once said "What you think, you become."
Even though it wasn't the Buddha, they have a point. People have no incentive to do
the little things that may contribute to their health if they have no context in how
it actually helps them. Enter MAP Training.

MAP Training is short for Mental and Physical Training and is simply a combination of exercise
and mental training.  What counts as mental training? It is thought to have to be strenuous and novel.
Meditation counts! Understanding a bit of biology on how mediation can impact the brain may convince people
to finally pick up that meditation routine and stick with it.

I recently gave a presentation at Hack Reactor on MAP Training
because I think that it can be a life changing way of looking at the world.
If you are interested in pushing you limits and becoming the best version of yourself,
check out my presentation below. Definitely not a full overview, if you are interested in more, check out:
