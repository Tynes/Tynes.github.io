title: BACh Helps People Learn Faster
subtitle: Technologically Mediated Learning

####

A new technology, called Brain Automated Chorales (or BACh) uses a [device](http://www.iss.com/biomedical/instruments/imagent.html)
to sense the brain activity of a human learning a task and automatically increases the difficulty of the task
as the person's brain activity indicates that they are gaining mastery.

This technology, created by [Beste Filiz Yuksel](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~byukse01/), has the potential to
drastically change the way that people learn things.  It is hard to imagine cutting the feedback loop of learning
any smaller without just downloading the skills directly into a person's brain.

While learning, a student is often scared to make mistakes and ask dumb questions. This is the best way to learn. An example of our egos getting the best of us. With this, you do not need to ever worry about being judged as "stupid" again.
Unless the machines start to bully humans...

I find this to be very exciting thing because of the potential it could offer, but this excitement could be biasing me to be blind to the potential problems this could create.

I would love to hear any arguments against why this should be adopted.

I would love to go more in depth about this topic, but Hack Reactor is keeping me super busy. It is only the second day and things are only going to get more hectic from here.
