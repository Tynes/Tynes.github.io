Welcome to the first post on my new blog.  Here you will find updates on my adventures.
If you are wondering why this is Part II - Hack Reactor, you must have missed Part I - Madagascar.
Well, that story has already been told, so I suppose all you need to know is that I like to go on adventures.

You can say that nobody *really* knows where they are going, but for now, I have myself some direction.
I am moving across the country to attend [Hack Reactor](www.hackreactor.com), the premier programming bootcamp located in
San Francisco, California.

Yeah, that's more like the adventure that I am about to go on.

I went to school for neuroscience in an attempt to discover the user's manual for the human experience, but came out empty handed.
Turns out, you can't figure out the secrets to life in 4 years.
So now, I turn my efforts to better understanding computers.
Computers are really good at certain things that the mind is not so good at, so I figure that the combination of the two may result in some unimaginable breakthroughs.

### Goals
* Complete Hack Reactor
* Obtain a job
* Learn everyday and do something huge

### End Notes
I am so grateful that Hack Reactor exists and is allowing me to continue my studies.
My brain is like a sponge and to be in such a stimulating environment will radically change my life.  Stay tuned for more adventures!
